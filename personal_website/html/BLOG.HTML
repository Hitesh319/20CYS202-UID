<a style="color: red;font-size:300%">From then I began explorig every single thing(planet,stars,galaxies...etc.) in this universe.
  But then there's this another interesting theory MULTIVERSE, where there are infinite possiblities of what is there outside of our universe.

  <a style="color: red;font-size:300%"> The average distance between galaxies is about one million light years. There are roughly 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe, so now you can imagine how far is another universefrom another universe.
 No human until now and willl neveer be able to travel a distance that far....And this is where black hole enters where it gives us a hope that there are more universes like ours. </a>
